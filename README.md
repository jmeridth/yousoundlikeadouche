# You Sound Like A Douche

A few words that I have found to be overused and/or misused in the tech industry that make people sound like a douche. Just use regular words.


#### This is for laughs

Don't take this serious. If you are offended it is possibly because you use one of these words often. I applaud your command of the English language. Hopefully this made you laugh.
